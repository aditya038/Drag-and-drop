# Drag-and-Drop Website Builder

A lightweight and interactive drag-and-drop website builder that allows users to dynamically add and position elements like **paragraphs, headings, buttons, and images** on a webpage. Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vite**, it demonstrates how to implement drag-and-drop using the **`DataTransfer` API**.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop Support**: Rearrange elements (paragraphs, headings, buttons, images) using native HTML5 drag-and-drop with the `DataTransfer` API.
- **Dynamic Layout**: Place and reposition elements freely on the canvas.
- **Intuitive UI**: User-friendly interface with visual feedback during drag and drop.
- **Customizable Elements** *(WIP)*: Designed for future enhancements such as style and content customization.
- **Fast Build Tooling**: Powered by Vite for lightning-fast development and build processes.

## Elements Supported

- **Paragraph**
- **Heading**
- **Button**
- **Image**

## Drag-and-Drop Mechanism

The drag-and-drop feature is implemented using the native HTML5 `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `drop` events. The `DataTransfer` object is used to pass information about the dragged element between events, enabling smooth placement of elements.
